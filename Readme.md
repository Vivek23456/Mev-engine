**🛡️ MEV Protection Engine**
Protecting users from harmful MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) during token swaps
📌 Overview

MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) is the value that bots extract by manipulating transaction ordering on blockchains.
During swaps (Token A ↔ Token B), bots monitor the mempool and perform attacks such as:

Front-running

Sandwich attacks

Backrunning / arbitrage extraction

Price manipulation during buying pressure

These attacks cause:

Higher slippage

Worse execution prices

Loss of value for normal users

This project focuses on GOOD MEV — protecting users from harmful bots.

🎯 What This Engine Does

The MEV Protection Engine monitors token swaps in real time and protects users from malicious exploitation.

✔️ Prevents Sandwich Attacks

Stops bots from:

Buying before the user (front-run)

Selling after the user (back-run)

✔️ Detects Price Manipulation

During a token swap:

High buying pressure

Temporary price corrections

Abnormal price impact

The engine identifies and blocks manipulative transactions.

✔️ Protects User Swap Execution

Ensures that swaps (Token A ↔ Token B) execute fairly without interference from high-frequency bots.

✔️ Mempool-Level Monitoring

Analyzes:

Pending transactions

Bot signature patterns

Suspicious routing activity

Abnormal gas usage

Profit-seeking sequences

✔️ Prevents Arbitrage Exploitation

Bots that try to immediately arbitrage after a user’s trade are detected and blocked.

✔️ Provides Private / Protected Routing

Ensures transactions are routed through:

Private mempools

Protected bundles

Channels where bots cannot see them

🧠 Why This is GOOD MEV

Not all MEV is bad.

Bad MEV:

Sandwiching

Price exploitation

User losses

Good MEV (our focus):

Protecting users

Fair transaction ordering

Secure swap execution

Transparent and safe DeFi ecosystem

This engine eliminates harmful MEV instead of extracting it.
